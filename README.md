# To Do List

* Used Layered architecture separating Data access from Api service
* As a DBMS used SQL Server 2022
* Both Database and API run with Docker Compose in separate containers
* Tests are written for the controller, but because of simplicity and framework taking care of incoming model formats, there is little to test
* Could have built a simple client UI for the API, but decided it's better to finish fast with what was requested (As I am looking for a Back End Developer position)
